<li>👨‍🎓  This project is my final thesis for the master's degree that I'm taking on Science and GIS.</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<li>🎯  The goal is to build a website, where the users can create places (by adding a pin to the map) with different information about it, that in the end would help travelers and tourists knowing what to do and where to go (by implementing routes, e.g.).</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<li>🌍 If they just discover, for example, a great spot to watch the sunrise they can create a pin on that place saying that is a beautiful place to watch it (along with other information that they may find relevant).</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<li>🗺️ Besides this (and because the degree is related to Geography), I'm also planning on adding features to get spatial data, creating maps with the user (or many users) data, etc.</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<li>💻 The website does look good already and has many featuers that I'm really happy with like Auth, Back-end (MongoDB), adding the places and their info, and many other features.</li>
